## Known problems

- if you can't open any sites from this parser in your browser (probably your IP address is blocked) you can't get a results from this parser;
- sometimes Hotels.com does not load the place input field (which happens in the usual browser too), so it can crash. You need to wait time;
- parsed sites often change their structure or selectors, so from time to time one of the scraping fields can't be gotten (sometimes the parser can crash). Please [open an issue](https://github.com/dimitryzub/hotels-scraper-js/issues/new) with your problem.
